## App Description
Our website will be an online gaming site where users can:
 * Acquire and use a universal virtual currency 
 * Play games including 
    * Plinko: Users drop a chip, and it lands in a slot that either awards or decrements currency 
    * Poker: Texas Holdâ€™em and Chinese Poker (Rules will be incorporated on the site)
    * Blackjack: Users try to get closer to 21, but not exceed it

We aim to create an engaging experience that utilizes Flask, a simple user account system, Bootstrap for our front end framework, and RESTful APIS.
